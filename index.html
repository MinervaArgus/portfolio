        <h2>📜 Manifest 📜</h2>
        <p>
         I have always had a deep interest in technology and how it can be used to solve problems creatively. 
         Ever since senior year of high school, I have been learning and experimenting with new technologies and learning how to code.
         I hope to continue my journey of using technology to solve problems creatively, whether it be through 3D Modeling, Animation, or Web Development.
